## What is a release?

GLTD releases are a unique distribution medium. Each release comprises one or more tracks presented through an interactive website. Each site is a collaborative effort between the artists and the label. We believe that these sites are a unique and novel alternative to music being presented online as mere content in congested streams.

## Where will releases be available for streaming / purchase?

GLTD will put your music up on our Youtube, Bandcamp and Soundcloud.  We hope to eventually work with Boomkat as well. If you want to get your music on other platforms, we’re willing to explore that option on a case-by-case basis.

## How / when do I get paid?

GLTD sells its releases exclusively through Bandcamp. However, artists are also permitted to sell their music through their own Bandcamp or any other digital distribution platform. We will split whatever we sell through our channels 50/50. You keep whatever you sell through your own channels.

Royalties will be distributed on a quarterly basis (January 1, April 1, July 1, October 1)

## Who owns what?

You own your masters and licensing rights and can re-sell or re-release your music whenever and wherever you like.

## What if another label wants to release my music physically ?

That’s great! All we ask is that your working with another label does not necessitate us taking our release down off the web.  We want you to to be able to pursue whatever opportunities may come your way, but we also want to maintain the work that we do together.
